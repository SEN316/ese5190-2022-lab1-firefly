In part 3.2, we track the brightness of screen by using the RP2040 board and the photodiodes on the APDS9960. We program the embedded system in order to make its RGB LED tracks the brightness reading from its color sensor. We use vieo (https://youtu.be/BtCGtaMrBXQ?t=413) to test the embedded system and the gif above shows the result of it.
